    		<h3><bold>Introduction</bold></h3>
		<p>The Providential Mathematics Olympiad (PMO) is a challenging olympiad-style mathematics competition which focuses on the development of problem-solving, creative and logical thinking skills. 
		What makes this competition unique is that it requires competitors to communicate their ideas through a variety of formats.  
		We believe these are important skills that aspiring mathematicians should acquire at an early stage. In addition, such experiences are often a valuable learning process that cannot be achieved by solving a lot of problems, hence making it an effective alternative to traditional competition training. </p> 
		
		<h3><bold>Why Attend</bold></h3>
		<p>People attend olympiads for different reasons, and it varies from person to person. Sometimes, going through problem sets every day can feel boring and repetitive, and the intense environment of an olympiad can be a great way to recharge.
			Other times you just want to see how well you've studied, to take on a challenge, to showcase your problem-solving ability, or just to have fun. The goal of the PMO is to encourage the exchange and communication of creative ideas, as well as helping participants think about problems more rigorously and deeply. Even if you don't have these demands, participating won't do you any harm (and it's free!). </p>
    		
		<h3><bold>The Details</bold></h3>
		<p>The first two rounds are similar to what you'll find in most major olympiad, except that the second round requires competitors to record a video as a response to a certain task which will be decided by the committee. The third round, on the other hand,
			is what we hope will be the fun part. Level I participants will engage with other competitors in a Socratic Seminar, where a problem is given and participants take turns "building" a solution. Level II participants will be randomly given a problem they haven't seen before, and compete to see who first gets to the correct answer, after which they will be allowed to discuss freely. Level III participants will debate on a math problem designed by the committee. </p>
		
		<h3><bold>Our Sponsors</bold></h3>
		<p>The PMO needs sponsors to help with the distribution of prizes and provide necessary support for the competition to work smoothly. If you are willing to sponsor us (or know someone who's able to), please contact us at providence641@gmail.com.</p>

		<h3><bold>Join Us</bold></h3>
		<p>The competition committee of the PMO renews on an annual basis to ensure a fresh supply of ideas and insight every year. On the other hand, the PMO would be impossible to hold without support from volunteer problem writers to provide us creative and original problems for the PMO. 
			If you want to become a committee member, please fill out this form. To learn more about problem writing, you can check this out. </p>
