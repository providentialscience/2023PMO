		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>The Providential Mathematics Olympiad is an annual competition designed to challenge and engage students with a strong interest in mathematics. The competition focuses on problem-solving skills, creativity, and ingenuity, rather than breadth of mathematical knowledge. Participants are given a set of challenging problems and are given a limited amount of time to solve them.</p>
		<p>The competition is open to all students with a strong foundation in mathematics, from middle school to high school. It provides an opportunity for students to showcase their skills, learn from their peers, and gain valuable experience in problem-solving and critical thinking.</p>

		<h2>Format/Rules</h2>
		<p>The Providential Mathematics Olympiad is a written exam that consists of several challenging problems, designed to test the problem-solving skills of participants. The problems are taken from a variety of mathematical disciplines, including algebra, geometry, number theory, and combinatorics.</p>
		<p>Participants are given a limited amount of time to solve the problems, and are not allowed to use calculators or any other external aids. The competition is divided into several rounds, with the top performers from each round advancing to the next stage. The final round determines the winners of the competition.</p>
